# ConnectFour-Extra
Game of connect four with special game modes
Special game modes include XL board size 10x9, extra player (three players), and double turn - each player gets to place 2 pieces per turn
Code comes with defualt game settings and two "Accounts" named after me and a friend, these accounts track scores and keep scores in a database
To change account names or default rules edit line 12 on file "Program.cs", keep in mind different rulesets may require more parameters
Thank you,
